                    I am a widowed, mother of 3 successful young adults, local to Carmel Valley, San
                    Diego. I have lived in my home for the past 24 years, and 14 of those years have
                    been as a single mom. I have learned so much and want to share it with you!

                    Iâ€™m grateful to have a wonderful home, and have been able to maintain, remodel
                    and make repairs when needed. The raising of my 3 children required a caregiver
                    who was able to operate under stress, in unpredictable, uncharted situations,
                    and create a smoothly run, warm and caring environment, a cozy household, all
                    while able to function well within normal hours! I have a background in
                    psychology and strive to increase efficiency, organization and comfort, to
                    furthermore increase overall happiness , health and well-being in the home. I am
                    available to help right now!
