## Quick Start

First, download the required npm packages.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the appropriate command for your purposes.

```bash
npm run [start / build]
```

### Deployment

On every push to main, a new branch will be created using GitHub actions, containing source code needed for a GitHub Pages deployment. To finish the setup, do the following:

1. Go to `Settings` in your repository.
2. Click `Pages` on the left menu.
3. Select the `gh-pages` branch from the dropdown. Leave `root` as `/`.
4. Your site will go live!

For additional configuration, you can add a custom domain and HTTPS support.
