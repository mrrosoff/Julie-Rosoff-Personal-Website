# Julie Rosoff's Personal Website

### Family Concierge, Personal Assistant, and Lifestyle Manager

## About Project

This template repository is a great starting point for a github pages static website. Utilizing Node, Vite, and React, the template is ready for both development and production.

The template comes bundled with the following technology.

## Quick Start

First, download the required npm packages.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the appropriate command for your purposes.

```bash
npm run [start / build]
```

When deploying to production, remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` and purge it from your repository.

### Deployment

On every push to main, a new branch will be created using GitHub actions, containing source code needed for a GitHub Pages deployment. To finish the setup, do the following:

1. Go to `Settings` in your repository.
2. Click `Pages` on the left menu.
3. Select the `gh-pages` branch from the dropdown. Leave `root` as `/`.
4. Your site will go live!

For additional configuration, you can add a custom domain and HTTPS support.
